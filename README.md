# AI text detector
AI text detection is applied using multiple types of models, and writing style classification is performed using K-means and PCA.

Note: The included data is solely an example and is too small and lacks variation. Feel free to use your own data. 
The models are currently configured for this sample data, so feel free to tweak the number of extracted features, the number of epochs, and the neural network structure as needed.
